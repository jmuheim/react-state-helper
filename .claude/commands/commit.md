description: Commit the working tree and, on a PR branch, bring the PR title and description up to date in the same pass

Commit the current changes: $ARGUMENTS

Whenever the user asks for a commit (also in plain words, without this command), follow these steps — the point of this command is that a commit on a PR branch and the PR title/description update are **one unit of work**, never two.

1. Run `npm test`. If it fails, stop and report — do not commit.
2. Review `git status` and `git diff` to write an accurate message. House style: conventional-commit prefix (`feat:`/`fix:`/`docs:`/…), imperative mood, reference a decision number when one was logged (e.g. `(decision #51)`).
3. Commit everything that belongs to the change.
4. If the current branch is not `master`, sync the PR — do not wait for a push or a hook reminder (commits can reach origin without an explicit push in this setup):
   - `gh pr view --json title,body` (skip this step if there is no open PR).
   - Compare title **and** body against what the branch now contains. A PR whose scope grew needs a new title, not just a new body.
   - Update whatever is stale with `gh pr edit`. Keep the body's structure (What / How / Docs / Before-deploy warning) and its trailing "Generated with Claude Code" line.
5. Report: commit hash, test result, and whether the PR title/body were updated or already accurate.
