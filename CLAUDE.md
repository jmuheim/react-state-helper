# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project purpose

A plain JavaScript library for managing hierarchical app state (modules → sessions → activities) as JSON, designed to be copy-pasted into MobileCoach (a mobile health platform).

## Documentation

Detailed documentation lives in `docs/`, published via GitHub Pages at https://jmuheim.github.io/react-state-helper/ — **the docs site is the source of truth**; this file and the README only keep essentials plus links. When a change makes a docs page stale, update the page.

- `docs/developer-guide.md` — architecture, data model, state validation, flow-logic (query) commands, test setup, full MobileCoach platform constraints.
- `docs/content-editor-guide.md` — MobileCoach setup for content editors (doer commands only: enter, complete, populate menus); contains the canonical **wrapper variable table** (checked by the edit-time hook and `npm test`).

## Commands

```bash
npm test              # run all tests once
npm run test:watch    # re-run on file changes
```

Run a single test by name:
```bash
npx vitest run -t "returns true when all activities are completed"
```

Small changes (typo/doc fixes) can skip the PR flow via the `/push-to-master` command: it runs the tests locally, temporarily adds an admin bypass to the `protect-master` ruleset, pushes, and restores protection.

## Decision log & open questions

Design decisions and their rationale (including rejected alternatives) live in `docs/decisions.md` — append-only and numbered. Check it before re-opening a settled question; add entries via the `/log-decision` command, which also propagates the decision to affected docs. Unresolved items live in `docs/open-questions.md`; when one is settled, graduate it into the decision log and delete it there.

## Pre-merge checklist

- New/changed behavior has tests; `npm test` is green.
- Any new wrapper variable is added to the variable table in `docs/content-editor-guide.md` **and** declared in MobileCoach (default `0`, access "manageable by service") before deploy.
- `src/ReactStateHelper.js` is still one self-contained script — enforced by `test/MobileCoachPlatformConstraints.test.js`.
- README / CLAUDE.md / docs pages / `docs/decisions.md` are updated wherever the change makes them stale.

## Architecture

All logic lives in `src/ReactStateHelper.js`. There are four classes:

| Class | Role |
|---|---|
| `Activity` | Bottom of the hierarchy (contains no children) — tracks `completed`, `times_entered`, timestamps |
| `Session` | Contains activities; `isCompleted()` iff all activities completed |
| `Module` | Contains sessions; exposes `countCompletedSessions`, `getProgress` |
| `ReactStateHelper` | Public API; holds `#state` (private); navigated via `currentModuleId / currentSessionId / currentActivityId` |

Details (id conventions, state validation, navigation model, serialization) are in `docs/developer-guide.md`.

Test setup: `vitest.config.js` lists `src/ReactStateHelper.js` as a `setupFile`, which registers `ReactStateHelper` as `globalThis.ReactStateHelper` — tests import nothing, mirroring MobileCoach's plain-script environment.

## MobileCoach constraints (essentials)

Full section in `docs/developer-guide.md` — these constraints drive most design decisions:

- The deployed artifact is one self-contained script: no `import`/`export`, no Node.js globals (`process` is used to detect Node vs. MobileCoach).
- Every `$variable` the script might write must be pre-declared in MobileCoach (default `0`, access "manageable by service") — a missing one makes the script **fail silently mid-flow**.
- State persists only as a JSON string round-tripped through `$jsStateHelperJson`; `0` means first run → fresh default state.
- Commands dispatch by `eval`-ing `$jsStateHelperCmd`; errors are surfaced via `$jsStateHelperStatus`/`$jsStateHelperError`.
- Menus are static: 9 slots (a self-imposed choice, not a MobileCoach platform limit). Labels (`$jsStateHelperMenuLabel1`–`9`, format `"<emoji> <title>"`) and ids (`$jsStateHelperMenuId1`–`9`) are separate variables, concatenated per slot in MobileCoach as `$jsStateHelperMenuLabelN:$jsStateHelperMenuIdN`; on tap MobileCoach splits on `:`, stores the id in a reserved variable, and navigates directly to the dialog with that id.
- Ids are globally unique across the whole state (each id names a MobileCoach dialog) and level-prefixed (`m_`/`s_`/`a_`).
- Flow branching only reads `$variable` content — booleans and label strings are the library's primary outputs.
